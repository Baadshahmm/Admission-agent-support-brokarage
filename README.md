Made a system for an NGO which helps connect Indian students to some people in abroad which are willing to help them with some info about the college they are trying to get into.
It had various views, first for admin who can administer and authorize the agents(people abroad willing to help). Other view for the agents who can see all the student request along with the college they want to get into but we kept the resume and some other details private which will be disclosed only when the student approves the agent.
Agents will review students profile based on their GRE Toefl marks , projects, job profile and other info and advice them with the college and we also kept a panel where they can mark the colleges as easy targets, ambitious and over ambitious targets.

It was developed as a part of 24hrs hackathon by my team which had 3 members and we were able to secure first prize for this competition.
